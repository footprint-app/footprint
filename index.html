              <p>Discovery is a word that follows us. It is a word that makes us unique and wanting to know more. Our inspiration arose from the desire to discover a world around us using this developing digital playground. There are always huge dangers in seeking out the undiscovered, but it is important to always be safe and aware of what lies ahead.</p>

            <p>With high rewards, there is always risk. Most of these undiscovered locations or hidden locations are off trail. They require you to tread lands which may have been untouched by many people. We encourage you to discover, but we highly encourage you to be prepared. Our application focuses on safety and we will always make sure you are prepared for adventures to come.</p>
